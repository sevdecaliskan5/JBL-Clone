# JBL Clone
I recreated a product page design for the JBL brand using HTML5 and SCSS. This project is an e-commerce page interface that introduces JBL's speakers, headphones, in-ear headphones, and gaming equipment.

# Technologies Used
**HTML5:** Used for structuring the page layout and content.

**SCSS:** Used for modern, flexible, and maintainable style files.

# Features
This project includes the following features:

**Responsive Design:** A modern, mobile-friendly design that adapts to different screen sizes.

**Navigation Menu:** A fixed menu that allows users to easily navigate through the page content.

**Product Showcasing:** Sections that highlight JBL products (speakers, headphones, in-ear headphones, gaming).

**Music and Gaming Equipment:** Featuring JBL's popular products, with a bestsellers section.

**Smooth Animations:** Soft, fluid animations applied throughout the site using SCSS. Hover effects, fades, and slide-ins enhance the user interaction, making the page feel more dynamic and interactive.
